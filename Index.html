          <h2>Cornwall Park</h2>
          <p>
            Spread over 425 acres, the Cornwall Park is symbolic of New
            Zealand’s history, flora, fauna and farm culture. It’s located in
            the heart of Auckland and offers a wide array of activities. One can
            go for a casual stroll with loved ones in the lush green
            surroundings of the trails and then enjoy a cup of coffee or a meal
            from its eateries, get together with friends and family over
            barbeque, exploring the cattle in the farm and other horticulture
            activities. From visiting the historic Acacia cottage built in the
            1800s to playing sports in the clubs - this place is a popular spot
            for all age groups with varied interests. Exercising, doing yoga
            while basking in stillness and connecting to Mother Nature with
            birds chirping in the background is nothing short of eternal bliss.

          <p>
            Rangitoto is the youngest and the largest volcano of Auckland's
            extensive volcanic field. This island can be seen directly from the
            mainland as it's wide symmetric conical shape forms an iconic
            silhouette in the distance. After taking the ferry from the harbour,

            this imposing volcano island. Hike up to the top, exploring the
            black lava caves on the way, to enjoy a view well worth the labour!

          <p>
            First established in 1888, the Auckland Art Gallery, or Toi o

            body of both national and international art exhibits. Set in the
            heart of central Auckland, bound by Albert Park, Auckland Art
            Gallery is only a two-minute walk from major bus stations in

            than 15,000 works of art ranging from native Maori traditional
            paintings to 19th-century landscapes of old European masters, to
            contemporary works of New Zealand’s artists and everything in
            between
